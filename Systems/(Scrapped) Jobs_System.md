# Jobs System

**Purpose:** Active earning through task-based gameplay with progression.
**Status:** Concept Phase
**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Core Concept

Jobs are **task-based gameplay loops**, not roleplay. Players complete specific actions, earn rewards, and progress through tiers.

**Key Principles:**
- No acting required — just complete tasks
- Clear progression (Entry → Skilled)
- Each job has unique gameplay
- Jobs contribute to Fame and Economy
- No premium currency requirements

| **Skilled** | Job Level 10 + $1,000 | $25-40/task | More involved tasks |

### Job Leveling

## Job Progression Incentives

### Why Level Up Jobs?

| Milestone | Reward | Incentive |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Level 5 | +10% pay bonus | More money per task |
| Level 10 | Unlock Skilled tier | Better tasks, more rewards |
| Level 15 | Job cosmetic set | Flex your dedication |
| Level 20 | Job title + Rare Lootbox | "Master Chef", "Expert Driver" |

### Why Unlock Skilled Tier?

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Higher pay | 2-3x Entry pay |
| More Fame | +1-2 Fame per task |
| Exclusive content | Access areas only Skilled can enter |
| Cosmetics | Skilled-tier outfits |
| Prestige | Visible skill commitment |

### Unlock Cost

**Skilled Unlock = Job Level 10 + $1,000**

This creates:
- Cash sink (affordable but meaningful)
- Meaningful progression gate
- Decision point (which career to invest in first?)

---

## Job Switching

**Players can do any job at any time.** No commitment required.

| Rule | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Switch freely | Variety keeps gameplay fresh |
| All progress saved | Never lose job levels |
| No penalties | Encourage exploration |
| Specialize if desired | Bonuses for focus |

### Specialization Bonus

If a player reaches Level 20 in a job:
- +15% pay for that job permanently
- "Master" title available
- Exclusive master cosmetic
- 1 Rare Lootbox reward

**Clarification:** The +15% bonus only applies when doing THAT specific job. Switching jobs doesn't transfer the bonus.

---

## Daily Job Bonuses

**First job task each day = 2x rewards**

Encourages daily engagement without forcing grind.

| Bonus | Details |
|-------|---------|
| First task of the day | 2x Cash, 2x XP |
| Three different jobs in a day | Bonus $200 |
| Complete 20 tasks in a day | Bonus 10 Gems |

---

## Job XP Rates

| Action | XP Gained |
|--------|-----------|
| Entry task completed | 15 XP |
| Skilled task completed | 25 XP |
| Perfect task (fast/accurate) | +5 bonus XP |
| Daily first task | 2x XP |

**Time to Level 10:**
- ~100 Entry tasks
- At 1 minute per task = ~1.5-2 hours of job work
- Spread over days = achievable in first few days

---

## Job Economy Balance

### Cash Per Hour (Target)

| Job Tier | Tasks/Hour | Cash/Task | Cash/Hour |
|----------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Entry | 30-40 | $12 avg | $360-480 |
| Skilled | 20-30 | $32 avg | $640-960 |

**Note:** These are active play rates. AFK/idle earnings are separate and lower.

### Compared to Other Sources

| Source | Cash/Hour |
|--------|-----------|
| Entry Jobs | $400 |
| Skilled Jobs | $800 |
| Minigames | $400-600 |
| AFK Idle | $50-100 |
| Trading | Variable |

Jobs should be competitive but not dominant. Minigames are comparable for variety.

---

## Minigames (Separate from Jobs)

Minigames are **standalone activities**, not jobs. They exist in:
- Public areas (anyone can join)
- Party apartments (during hosted parties)
- Event venues (seasonal)

### Minigame List

| Minigame | Type | Rewards |
|----------|------|---------|
| Parkour | Timed race | $30-50 + Fame |
| Fishing Tournament | Competition | $50-100 + prizes |
| Trivia | Knowledge | $20-40 + Fame |
| Racing | Foot/boat | $30-50 + Fame |
| Hide & Seek | Social | $20-30 |
| Rhythm Game | Music | $25-45 |

### Minigame vs Job

| Aspect | Jobs | Minigames |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Availability | Always | Scheduled/area-based |
| Progression | Job levels, titles | Leaderboards |
| Rewards | Steady Cash | Variable Cash + Fame |
| Social | Solo activity | Often multiplayer |

---

## Open Questions

| Question | Considerations |
|----------|----------------|
| Exact task mechanics | Depends on Hytale's capabilities |
| Job count at launch | Start with 4-5, expand later? |
| Minigame variety | Which are feasible to build? |
| Sanitation inclusion | Keep as low-effort option? |
| Competitive jobs? | Bounty hunter, competitive fishing? |

---

- Active earning alternative to minigames
- Clear progression with meaningful unlocks
