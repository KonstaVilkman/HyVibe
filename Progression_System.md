# Progression System

**Purpose:** Long-term goals that keep players engaged and create aspiration.  
**Status:** Concept Phase

---

## Core Concept

Progression is about **giving players reasons to keep playing**. Every action should feel like it contributes to growth.

**Key Principles:**
- Multiple progression tracks (not just one number)
- Always something to work toward
- Visible progress creates satisfaction
- Milestones unlock meaningful rewards

---

## Progression Tracks

| Track | What It Measures | Primary Benefit |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Player Level** | Overall account progress | Unlocks features, housing tiers |
| **Fame** | Social status/activity | Hosting bonuses, titles |
| **Job Levels** | Career progression | Better pay, skilled tiers |
| **Collections** | Items gathered | Completion bonuses |
| **Achievements** | Milestones completed | Orbs, cosmetics |

---

## Player Level

### How You Earn XP

| Source | XP Amount | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Time online (passive) | +5 XP/min | Always earning while online |
| Job task | +10-20 XP | Active work |
| Minigame played | +15-30 XP | Participation |
| Minigame won | +25-50 XP | Skill reward |
| Daily login | +100 XP | Show up bonus |
| Achievement unlocked | +50-500 XP | One-time spikes |
| Event participation | +30-100 XP | Engagement reward |

**Passive XP:** All players earn 5 XP per minute just for being online. No restrictionsâ€”whether you're active, idle, or AFK, you're progressing. This ensures you're always working toward the next level.

### XP Curve

| Level Range | Total XP to Reach | XP Per Level (Avg) |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1-10 | 0-5,000 | ~500 |
| 11-50 | 5,000-65,000 | ~1,500 |
| 51-100 | 65,000-215,000 | ~3,000 |
| 101-200 | 215,000-715,000 | ~5,000 |
| 201-300 | 715,000-1,515,000 | ~8,000 |
| 301-400 | 1,515,000-2,715,000 | ~12,000 |
| 401-500 | 2,715,000-4,215,000 | ~15,000 |

**Design Intent:**
- Early levels (1-50): Fast, rewardingâ€”players see progress quickly
- Mid levels (51-200): Steady climbâ€”commitment shows results
- Late levels (201-500): True dedicationâ€”these are the veterans

**Why 500?** Big enough to feel impressive, small enough to stay comprehensible. No one wants to explain they're "level 47,382."

### Level Time Estimates

Based on 5 XP/min idle + active play bonuses (avg ~500-800 XP/hour):

| Level | Approx. Time | Playstyle |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 10 | 5-10 hours | New player milestone |
| 50 | 80-120 hours | Committed player |
| 100 | 250-400 hours | Regular player |
| 200 | 800-1,200 hours | Dedicated player |
| 300 | 1,800-2,400 hours | Veteran |
| 400 | 3,000-4,000 hours | Elite |
| 500 | 4,500-6,000 hours | Legend |

**Reality Check:** These are total playtime hours, spread over months or years. A player logging 2 hours/day reaches level 100 in 4-7 months, level 500 in 6-8 yearsâ€”perfect for long-term MMO engagement.

## Passive Progression & Bonuses

### Base Passive XP

**Everyone earns 5 XP/min while online. No strings attached.**

- Active playing? +5 XP/min
- Standing still? +5 XP/min  
- AFK in your apartment? +5 XP/min

**Philosophy:** Your time matters. Whether you're grinding or chatting with friends, you're progressing.

### Bonus Multipliers (From Gear/Items)

Players can boost their **overall** XP gain through equipment and cosmetics:

| Item Type | Max Bonus | Stacking |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Outfit | +10% XP | One equipped |
| Pet | +5% XP | One active |
| Furniture (home) | +5% XP | While in apartment |
| **Total Cap** | **+20% XP** | Cannot exceed |

**Example:**
- Base: 5 XP/min = 300 XP/hour
- With +20% gear: 6 XP/min = 360 XP/hour
- Doing jobs/minigames on top? Even faster

**No Power Creep:** These percentages are LOCKED. Future items have the same caps, just different aesthetics. A level 500 player and a level 50 player with the same gear get the same % bonus.

---

## Build System (Stat Focus)

### The Concept

Players can't max everything. They choose a focus.

| Build Type | Focus | Good At | Trades Off |
|------------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Grinder** | +XP bonuses | Leveling fast | Less Fame/Cash |
| **Hustler** | +Cash bonuses | Making money | Less XP/Fame |
| **Social** | +Fame bonuses | Status/hosting | Less XP/Cash |
| **Balanced** | Mixed | Decent at all | Master of none |

### How Builds Work

Items have stat bonuses, but you can only have ONE active set:

```
Example: Grinder Build
- Cozy Pajamas: +10% idle XP
- Study Pet: +5% XP from minigames
- Focus Lamp (furniture): +5% XP while home
= Total: +20% XP (at cap)

Example: Hustler Build  
- Business Suit: +10% Cash from jobs
- Money Cat Pet: +5% Cash from activities
- Lucky Coin (accessory): +5% Cash from minigames
= Total: +20% Cash (at cap)
```

**Switching:** Players can change builds anytime by switching gear.

## Anti-Grind Philosophy

**Progression should feel rewarding, not exhausting.**

| Design Choice | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Passive XP exists | Can progress without constant effort |
| Daily bonuses cap | No need to play 12 hours |
| Multiple tracks | Stuck on one? Progress on another |
| Catch-up mechanics | Events help newer players |
| No mandatory grind | All content eventually accessible |

---

## Open Questions

| Question | Considerations |
|----------|----------------|
| Exact XP numbers fine-tuning | Needs playtesting for feel |
| Post-500 progression? | Prestige system? Infinite scaling? Cap at 500? |
| Season pass inclusion | At launch or later feature? |
| Milestone reward balance | Are late-game rewards exciting enough? |
| XP bonus sources | Should events/special items offer temporary XP boosts? |

---

## Design Philosophy: Why Level 500?

**The Sweet Spot:**
- **Big enough:** Hitting level 300, 400, 500 feels like a huge achievement
- **Comprehensible:** You can grasp the scale without scientific notation
- **Long-term:** Years of progression without hitting arbitrary caps
- **Status:** High levels are immediately impressive to other players

**Contrast:**
- Too low (Level 100 cap): Feels limiting, veterans max out fast
- Too high (Level 10,000+): Numbers lose meaning, "I'm level 8,473" â‰  flex

**The Target:**
- Casual players: Level 50-150 over months
- Regular players: Level 200-350 over a year+
- Dedicated players: Level 400-500 over years
- The level 500s: Legends of the server
