# Progression System

**Purpose:** Long-term goals that keep players engaged and create aspiration.
**Status:** Concept Phase
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Core Concept

Progression is about **giving players reasons to keep playing**. Every action should feel like it contributes to growth.

**Key Principles:**
- Multiple progression tracks (not just one number)
- Always something to work toward
- Visible progress creates satisfaction
- Milestones unlock meaningful rewards + Lootboxes
- Realistic timelines based on actual play

---

## Progression Tracks

| Track | What It Measures | Primary Benefit |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Player Level** | Overall account progress | Unlocks features, housing tiers |
| **Fame** | Social status/activity | Hosting bonuses, titles |
| **Job Levels** | Career progression | Better pay, skilled tiers |
| **Collections** | Items gathered | Completion bonuses |
| **Achievements** | Milestones completed | Gems, Lootboxes, cosmetics |

---

## Player Level

### No Level Cap

**Players can grind as much as they want.** There is no maximum level. High levels become a flex and show dedication.

### How You Earn XP

| Source | XP Amount | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Time online (passive) | +5 XP/min | Always earning while online |
| Job task (Entry) | +15 XP | Active work |
| Job task (Skilled) | +25 XP | Better jobs = more XP |
| Minigame played | +20-40 XP | Participation |
| Minigame won | +50-80 XP | Skill reward |
| Daily login | +200 XP | Show up bonus |
| Achievement unlocked | +100-500 XP | One-time spikes |
| Event participation | +50-200 XP | Engagement reward |

**Passive XP:** All players earn 5 XP per minute just for being online. Simple and universal - no special zones required.

### XP Curve

| Level Range | XP Per Level | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| 1-10 | 500 | Fast early progress |
| 11-25 | 750 | Still accessible |
| 26-50 | 1,000 | Steady climb |
| 51-100 | 1,500 | Committed players |
| 101-200 | 2,000 | Dedicated grinders |
| 201-500 | 2,500 | True veterans |
| 501+ | 3,000 | Legends |

### Level Time Estimates

Based on 5 XP/min passive + active play (avg ~500-800 XP/hour):

| Level | Approx. Time | Playstyle |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 10 | 6-10 hours | New player milestone |
| 25 | 20-30 hours | First week player |
| 50 | 50-70 hours | Regular player |
| 100 | 120-160 hours | Committed player |
| 200 | 300-400 hours | Dedicated grinder |
| 500 | 1,000+ hours | Legend status |

**No Cap Philosophy:** Let players grind. High levels become meaningful status symbols. Someone at Level 500+ has serious dedication.

## Passive Progression

### Base Passive XP

**Everyone earns 5 XP/min while online. No strings attached.**

- Active playing? +5 XP/min
- Standing still? +5 XP/min
- AFK anywhere? +5 XP/min

**Philosophy:** Your time matters. Whether you're grinding or chatting with friends, you're progressing. No special zones needed - just be online.

### Optional: Bonus Multipliers (From Gear/Items)

Players can boost their XP gain through equipment:

| Item Type | Max Bonus | Stacking |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Outfit | +10% XP | One equipped |
| Pet | +5% XP | One active |
| **Total Cap** | **+15% XP** | Cannot exceed |

**Example:**
- Base: 5 XP/min = 300 XP/hour
- With +15% gear: 5.75 XP/min = 345 XP/hour
- Doing jobs/minigames on top? Even faster

**No Power Creep:** These percentages are LOCKED. Future items have the same caps, just different aesthetics.

| Multiple tracks | Stuck on one? Progress on another |
| Catch-up mechanics | Events help newer players |
| No mandatory grind | All content eventually accessible |
| Lootboxes at milestones | Every milestone feels exciting |

---

## Open Questions

| Question | Considerations |
|----------|----------------|
| Exact XP numbers | Needs playtesting for feel |
| Season pass at launch? | Later feature? |
| Milestone reward scaling | Are high-level rewards exciting enough? |
| Level display format | Show exact level or use tiers for very high levels? |
