# Progression System

**Purpose:** Long-term goals that keep players engaged and create aspiration.
**Status:** Concept Phase
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Core Concept

Progression is about **giving players reasons to keep playing**. Every action should feel like it contributes to growth.

**Key Principles:**
- Multiple progression tracks (not just one number)
- Always something to work toward
- Visible progress creates satisfaction
- Milestones unlock meaningful rewards + Lootboxes
- Realistic timelines based on actual play

---

## Progression Tracks

| Track | What It Measures | Primary Benefit |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Player Level** | Overall account progress | Unlocks features, housing tiers |
| **Fame** | Social status/activity | Hosting bonuses, titles |
| **Job Levels** | Career progression | Better pay, skilled tiers |
| **Collections** | Items gathered | Completion bonuses |
| **Achievements** | Milestones completed | Gems, Lootboxes, cosmetics |

## Player Level

### How You Earn XP

| Source | XP Amount | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Time online (passive) | +10 XP/min | Always earning while online |
| Job task (Entry) | +15 XP | Active work |
| Job task (Skilled) | +25 XP | Better jobs = more XP |
| Minigame played | +20-40 XP | Participation |
| Minigame won | +50-80 XP | Skill reward |
| Daily login | +200 XP | Show up bonus |
| Achievement unlocked | +100-500 XP | One-time spikes |
| Event participation | +50-200 XP | Engagement reward |

**Passive XP:** All players earn 10 XP per minute just for being online. This ensures you're always working toward the next level whether active, idle, or AFK.

### XP Curve

| Level Range | XP Per Level | Total XP to Reach End |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1-10 | 500 | 5,000 |
| 11-25 | 750 | 16,250 |
| 26-40 | 1,000 | 31,250 |
| 41-60 | 1,500 | 61,250 |
| 61-80 | 2,000 | 101,250 |
| 81-100 | 2,500 | 151,250 |

### Level Time Estimates

Based on 10 XP/min idle + active play bonuses (avg ~800-1,200 XP/hour):

| Level | Approx. Time | Playstyle |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 10 | 4-6 hours | New player milestone |
| 25 | 15-20 hours | First week player |
| 40 | 30-40 hours | Regular player |
| 60 | 60-80 hours | Committed player |
| 80 | 100-130 hours | Dedicated player |
| 100 | 150-200 hours | Veteran |

**Reality Check:** A player logging 2 hours/day reaches Level 40 in 2-3 weeks, Level 100 in 3-4 months. Achievable for casual players.

## Passive Progression & Bonuses

### Base Passive XP

**Everyone earns 10 XP/min while online. No strings attached.**

- Active playing? +10 XP/min
- Standing still? +10 XP/min
- AFK in your apartment? +10 XP/min

**Philosophy:** Your time matters. Whether you're grinding or chatting with friends, you're progressing.

### Bonus Multipliers (From Gear/Items)

Players can boost their XP gain through equipment:

| Item Type | Max Bonus | Stacking |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Outfit | +10% XP | One equipped |
| Pet | +5% XP | One active |
| Furniture (home) | +5% XP | While in apartment |
| **Total Cap** | **+20% XP** | Cannot exceed |

**Example:**
- Base: 10 XP/min = 600 XP/hour
- With +20% gear: 12 XP/min = 720 XP/hour
- Doing jobs/minigames on top? Even faster

**No Power Creep:** These percentages are LOCKED. Future items have the same caps, just different aesthetics.

---

## AFK Zones

**Designated chill spots with bonus idle rewards:**

| Zone | Bonus | Requirements |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Park Benches | +2 XP/min | None |
| Rooftop Lounge | +3 XP/min | Level 20+ |
| VIP Lounge | +5 XP/min | Fame: Celebrity+ |
| Zen Garden | +3 XP/min + $5/min Cash | Level 30+ |

**Note:** AFK zone bonuses stack with gear bonuses. A max-geared player in VIP Lounge earns 15+3 XP/min = 18 XP/min (1,080/hour) while AFK.
