## NPC Design Principles

1. **Clear Purpose** - Players should immediately understand what an NPC does
2. **Visible Indicators** - Shop icons, interaction prompts, distinct appearances
3. **Logical Placement** - NPCs belong where their service makes sense
4. **Non-Intrusive** - Don't block pathways or force interactions
