## Phase 0 Roadmap (Now → First Build)

### Step 1: Learn Hytale Tools (Week 1-4)

**Goal:** Understand what's possible in Hytale Early Access.

| Task | Priority | Time |
|------|----------|------|
| Install Hytale, explore the game | High | Day 1 |
| Watch official tutorials | High | Week 1 |
| Join Hytale modding Discord/communities | High | Week 1 |
| Experiment with basic building | High | Week 1-2 |
| Research scripting capabilities | Medium | Week 2-3 |
| Try Hytale Model Maker (if available) | Medium | Week 3-4 |

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Can we create instanced housing?
- Can we implement custom NPCs?
- Can we script custom jobs?
- Can we create lootbox UI?
- What are the server hosting options?

### Step 2: Build Proof of Concept (Week 5-8)

**Goal:** Create one small functional area to test ideas.

**Build:** Central Plaza (small version)
- One café building (interior + exterior)
- One park area with benches
- One shop building
- Basic NPC if possible
- Walking paths connecting areas

**Test:**
- Does it feel cozy?
- Is the scale right?
- Can players navigate easily?
- What's missing from the "vibe"?

### Step 3: Start Community (Week 4+)

**Goal:** Build audience before the server launches.

| Platform | Purpose | Content |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Discord | Community hub | Design discussions, sneak peeks, feedback |
| Twitter/X | Updates | Progress screenshots, announcements |
| YouTube | Showcase | Build timelapse, design philosophy |
| TikTok | Virality | Short clips, aesthetic moments |

**Early Community Goals:**
- 100 Discord members by end of Phase 0
- 5-10 people interested in helping
- Feedback on design docs

### Step 4: Find Team Members (Week 6+)

**Goal:** Identify people who can help build.

**Where to Find:**
- Hytale Discord servers
- Reddit r/Hytale
- Twitter Hytale community
- Your existing Discord

**What to Look For:**
- Passionate about social/chill games
- Willing to learn (no experts needed)
- Reliable and communicative
- Shares your vision

**Initial Roles Needed:**
1. **Builder** (1-2 people) - World building, environments
2. **Scripter** (1 person) - Game logic, if Hytale supports it

2. **Visual Style** - Cozy/warm vs modern/neon vs mixed
3. **Target Platform** - PC only or also mobile (depends on Hytale)

### During Phase 1:

1. **Lootbox Odds** - Test and adjust based on feel
2. **Cash Earning Rates** - Balance through playtesting
3. **Housing Instance Tech** - Adapt to Hytale's limitations

### Before Launch:

2. **Moderation Team** - Recruit trusted community members
3. **Server Infrastructure** - Hosting, scaling plan

## Risk Checklist

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Hytale can't do instanced housing | Design fallback (neighborhood plots) | Monitor |
| No scripting support | Simpler jobs (NPC-based) | Monitor |
| Can't find team members | Start smaller, solo-buildable MVP | Planning |
| Burnout | Set realistic pace, take breaks | Ongoing |
| Design doesn't feel fun | Playtest early, iterate | Phase 1 |
