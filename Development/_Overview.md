## Development Philosophy

> **Don't wait until everything is perfect.** Get a basic lobby working, invite people, and grow the community while building features.

**Why this works:**
- Early feedback shapes development
- Community grows alongside the server
- Players feel invested in the project
- You stay motivated seeing real people enjoy it
